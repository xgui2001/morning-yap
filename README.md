# üåÖ Morning Brain Dump

A voice-first web app where you can yap all your to-dos and let Gemini Live figure out the rest. It structure your day through natural conversation. Think "therapy session meets task manager" - you ramble, it organizes.

## üéØ Core Concept

**Voice-first organization**: Instead of typing out your to-dos, just talk naturally about your day. The AI listens, understands, and transforms your rambling thoughts into structured tasks and schedules.

**AI-powered organization**: Gemini Live handles both conversation AND task extraction in one go. No separate NLP components or complex state machines - just pure AI intelligence.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) - WebSocket support and simplicity
- **AI**: Gemini Live API - handles conversation + task extraction
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript - no framework overhead
- **Audio**: Web Audio API for mic capture, WebSocket for streaming
- **Deployment**: Runs locally or deploy to Render/Railway

### Philosophy
**"Let the LLM do everything"** - Instead of building separate NLP components, conversation state machines, or task extractors, we use Gemini's intelligence to handle the entire flow. One prompt, one API call, multiple outputs.

```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- ffmpeg (required for Whisper AI)
- Gemini API key

### Setup

1. **Clone and navigate to the project**
   ```bash
   cd alarm
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your GEMINI_API_KEY
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Use the quick start script
   chmod +x run.sh
   ./run.sh
   
   # Option 2: Run manually
   cd backend
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

## üé§ How to Use

1. **Click the mic button** to start recording
2. **Talk naturally** about your day, tasks, and thoughts
3. **Watch in real-time** as your conversation appears on the left
4. **See your organized day** appear on the right with tasks and schedule
5. **Export your data** when you're done

### Example Brain Dump
> "I have so much to do today. I need to finish that quarterly report by 3pm, call the dentist to reschedule my appointment, and I'm feeling really overwhelmed about the presentation tomorrow. Oh, and I should probably go to the gym, but I'm not sure when I'll have time. I also need to pick up groceries and maybe call my mom."

**AI Response**: 
- **Conversation**: "I hear you're feeling overwhelmed with everything on your plate today. Let's break this down into manageable pieces. You've got some important work deadlines, personal appointments, and self-care to balance."
- **Tasks**: 
  - Finish quarterly report (High priority, Work, 2 hours)
  - Call dentist (Medium priority, Health, 15 min)
  - Prepare presentation (High priority, Work, 3 hours)
  - Gym workout (Medium priority, Health, 1 hour)
  - Grocery shopping (Low priority, Errands, 45 min)
  - Call mom (Medium priority, Personal, 30 min)

## üîß Development

### Project Structure Details

#### Backend (`backend/app.py`)
- **FastAPI setup** with WebSocket endpoint
- **Gemini Live integration** for AI processing
- **Session management** (in-memory for hackathon)
- **Static file serving** for frontend

#### Frontend (`frontend/`)
- **Single page UI** with responsive design
- **WebSocket connection** management
- **Audio recording** and streaming
- **Real-time UI updates**

### Data Flow
1. User clicks mic ‚Üí Browser captures audio
2. Audio streams via WebSocket ‚Üí Backend receives chunks
3. Backend sends to Gemini Live ‚Üí Single API call
4. Gemini returns ‚Üí Conversational response + Structured task data
5. WebSocket sends back ‚Üí Both transcript and tasks
6. Frontend updates ‚Üí Real-time display of both panels

## üîë Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Gemini API key (required)
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 8000)
- `DEBUG`: Enable debug mode (default: false)

### API Keys
1. Get your Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Add it to your `.env` file
3. Restart the application

## üöÄ Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

### Production Deployment
The app is designed to be easily deployable to:
- **Render**: Add as a Python service
- **Railway**: Connect GitHub repo
- **Heroku**: Add Procfile and deploy
- **Vercel**: Configure for Python

### Environment Setup for Production
1. Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your deployment environment
2. Configure `PORT` if needed (most platforms auto-detect)
3. Ensure WebSocket support is enabled
